 *  @brief A structure for creating menu nodes
 *  @struct menuNode
 *
 *  This struct is general enough to use for any menu that our system needs to handle.
 *  It contains pointers for both parents and for children, as well as <b>REFERENCES</b> to strings
 *  stored in data memory. We actually pull out the string with our @ref "stringToRam" function.
 *  This struct also has a pointer to a display value for menus with dynamically changing text.
