 * @brief 	Sets up timer3 to work as a real time clock
 * @details Sets up the CCP2 mode to work with timer 3 and also
 * 			to interrupt when the CCP value has been reached.
 * 			
 * 			Timer3 is clocked from an external 4.096MHz clock.
 * 			With a prescaler of 255, it becomes a 16KHz clock
 * 			so we have up to 16 'submilliseconds' to work with
 *
 *			TMR3<0:3> will represent the time in quarts, whilst
 *			TMR3<4:15> represents the time in milliseconds 
 *			TMR3 is reset when it reaches 16000quarts
