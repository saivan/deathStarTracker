 * @brief Handles the data harvesting and distance calculations from the
 *        GP2Y0A02YK sensor
 *
 * @details The function does 1 of 2 things based on what state is in
 *          (the value of IRState)
 *
 * This takes denotes the 2 operating modes:
 *  GATHERING_DATA          - Do nothing if Temp Sensor is busy
 *                          - Change the AD Conversion Channel to that of the
 *                              IR sensor
 *                          - reset the IR flags
 *                          - If data is not ready to be collected: do nothing
 *                          - Store data into gatheredData[]
 *                          - If more data is needed, start AD conversion again
 *                          - If no more data is needed, set IRState to
 *                            CALCULATING_DISTANCE
 * CALCULATING_DISTANCE     - Find average of gathered data
 *                          - Calculate distance based on data and store in
 *                            IRDistance
 *                          - Set IRState to GATHERING_DATA
 *
 * If the distance calculated by this module is deemed invalid in any way,
 * IRDistance is set to a "null" value of 0 to rerpresent this fact.
